### ***Project 1 Feedback***

**Overall:** Good work! Your answers are on point! Also, very good use of the list and zip functions. Getting used to how python works, list comprehension, all of that saves a lot of time and energy.

**Something to think about:**
    We don't touch on it too much in class, but think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc.

***Note: if you ever feel a topic is too elementary, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings and I can send things your way (especially once we get into modeling!)***
