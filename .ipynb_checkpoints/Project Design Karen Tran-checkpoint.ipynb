    "Vox Media launched a beta version of a new ad product for clients who key performance indicator is viewability. This new ad displays on screen and in-view for X seconds. I want to predict the optimum in-view time in seconds that will yield the highest viewability rate.I also want to see if there is a strong correlation between in-view time and viewability. If not, which variable affects viewability most? Currently, our product team has been toying with two numbers: 10 seconds and 12.5 seconds, and performing simple A/B testing. This project will help determine the optimum time for this new product. "

This information helps me narrow down the seconds, but since the data for the ad unit is so small, it won't prove too useful. We have data from other similar ad units with in-view time and viewability rate that we can use. "

    "3. Does ad size matter? \n",

    "Another limitation is that this is based using only mobile data. Since the new ad unit is for mobile only, I believe it is okay to keep the project isolated to this device. \n",

My target audience, aka my product team, believes that time shows the strongest correlation and with some trial and error, 12.5 seconds is the ideal time for an ad to be in-view on a page. \n",

    "I don't think my model has to be incredibly complicated but I do want to run multiple tests to really understand the data and outcomes. Everyone would love a 100% success rate for this to be considered successful :) But I will be happy if I can just find an ideal in-view time along with any factors that I can use to predict the viewability rate for future campaigns as an optimization tool. \n",
